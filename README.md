Library to manage Laravel translations

## Installation

Require this package with composer:

```
composer require exolnet/laravel-translation
```

In Laravel 5.5, the service provider and facade will automatically get registered. For older versions of the framework, follow the steps below:

Register the service provider in `config/app.php`

```php
'providers' => [
    // [...]
    Exolnet\Translation\TranslationServiceProvider::class,
],
```

To make sure the routing system is using the one supporting the translation you must edit your `app/Http/Kernel.php` to add the usage of the custom user dispatcher

    use \Exolnet\Translation\Traits\CustomRouterDispatcher;

Now you're ready to start using the translation in your application.

#### Config Files

In order to edit the default configuration (where for e.g. you can find `available_locales`) for this package you may execute:

```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Exolnet\Translation\TranslationServiceProvider"
```

After that, `config/translation.php` will be created. Inside this file you will find all the fields that can be edited in this package.

## Usage

Exolnet Translation uses the URL given for the request. In order to achieve this purpose, a route group should be added into the `routes/web.php` file. It will filter all pages that must be localized.

```php
// routes/web.php

Route::groupLocales(function () {
    Route::get('/', ['as' => 'home', 'uses' => 'HomeController@index']);
});

```

Once this route group is added to the routes file, a user can access all locales added into `available_locales`. For example, a user can now access two different locales, using the following addresses:

```
http://url-to-laravel/en
http://url-to-laravel/fr
```

If you when to remove the locale prefix on the base locale you need to set the `$avoidPrefixOnBaseLocale` to `true` when defining the groupLocale

```php
// routes/web.php

Route::groupLocales(function () {
    Route::get('/', ['as' => 'home', 'uses' => 'HomeController@index']);
}, null, true);

```

#### Facades

Laravel Translation autoload a facade called `LaravelTranslation`. In this facade you will find functions like

- `getCurrentLocale` to retrieve the current locale
- `getCurrentLocaleName` to retrieve the current locale name
- `getCurrentLocaleNativeName` to retrieve the current locale native name

#### Blade views and directives
Laravel Translation offers some blade views and directives like

- `@currentLocale` to show the current locale
- `@currentLocaleName` to show the current locale name
- `@currentLocaleNativeName` to show the current locale native name

##### Language Switcher
In order to use the language switcher generated by LaravelTranslation you must include the `laravel-translation::language-switcher` in your blade templates like so : 

`@include('laravel-translation::language-switcher')`

## Testing
